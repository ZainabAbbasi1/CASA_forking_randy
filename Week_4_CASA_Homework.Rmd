```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(usethis)
library(sf)
library(here)
```

This is the library section

```{r cars}
geojson_Data<-st_read(here::here("World_Countries_(Generalized)_9029012925078512962.geojson"))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
